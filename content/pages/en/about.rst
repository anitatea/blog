Welcome to my blog - My passion is in Data Science, Analytics and Visualization. Technology, Business and Design.

On paper this is who I am:
- Senior Data Analyst @ Fiesta App
- Digital Specialist @ Digital Main Street & Shopify
- Management Consulting Analyst @ Accenture
- Nuclear Systems Engineer @ Ontario Power Generation

Python is my preferred language. I am able to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript but it's definitely not my favorite. Ehm, even if I don't like it very much, it's still useful here and there - it got your attention right?


Spare time

Then in my spare time, I craft jewelry. And pop-up cards. Then I love to sweat in hot yoga and try to do it as often as I can without having to go into public after looking like I hopped out of the pool.
I'm always learning and I have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
