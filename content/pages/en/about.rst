Well, as you can see I like wallace and gromit. I'm looking for opportunities as a Data Science and like Python most. I am able to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript but it's definitely not my favorite. Ehm, even if I don't like it very much, it's still useful here and there. Trying to get warm with golang (dislike absence of exceptions) and hater of ruby/perl. NodeJS is cool as well.
Bash is very useful but ugly as hell.

Then in my spare time, I craft jewelry. And pop-up cards. Then I love to sweat in hot yoga and try to do it as often as I can without having to go into public after looking like I hopped out of the pool.
I'm always learning and I have a hell of fun doing it.
