Welcome to my blog - I actually really like design but I love data science. I'm looking for opportunities as a Data Science and like Python most. I am able to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript but it's definitely not my favorite. Ehm, even if I don't like it very much, it's still useful here and there - it got your attention right?

Then in my spare time, I craft jewelry. And pop-up cards. Then I love to sweat in hot yoga and try to do it as often as I can without having to go into public after looking like I hopped out of the pool.
I'm always learning and I have a hell of fun doing it.
